# Project Summary

The interest for a product continues to change occasionally. No business can work on its monetary growth without assessing client interest and future demand of items precisely. Sales forecasting refers to the process of estimating demand for or sales of a particular product over a specific period of time. For a good sales forecast, it is extremely important to get a good dataset as well. Forecasts heavily depend on the past records, trends and patterns observed for sales of a particular store. The variations could be due to a number of reasons. Talking from a businessâ€™s point of view, these sales forecasts are done consistently to improve their sales forecasting models as they directly impact their decision making process, goals, plans and growth strategies. In this Retail Sales Prediction, machine learning models are created that predict sales of these 1115 drug stores across the European market and compare the results of these models. In addition to this, an effort has been made to analyze and find all the features that are contributing to higher sales and the features which are leading to lower sales, so that improvement plans can be worked upon.

# Problem Statement

Rossmann operates over 3,000 drug stores in 7 European countries. Currently, Rossmann store managers are tasked with predicting their daily sales for up to six weeks in advance. Store sales are influenced by many factors, including promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality. With thousands of individual managers predicting sales based on their unique circumstances, the accuracy of results can be quite varied. You are provided with historical sales data for 1,115 Rossmann stores. The task is to forecast the "Sales" column for the test set. Note that some stores in the dataset were temporarily closed for refurbishment.

# Data Description
